# Introduction

Welcome! I'm Matt Fishman,
[Associate Data Scientist at the Center for Computational Quantum Physics (CCQ)](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/matthew-fishman)
at the Flatiron Institute in New York.
I'm lead developer of
[ITensor](https://github.com/ITensor)
, a software library for easily developing and running efficient tensor
network calculations.

I am passionate about developing tensor network algorithms
(algorithms for low rank approximations of very high order tensors)
with applications to quantum physics, quantum computing,
chemistry, and data science, and providing high performance implementations of those
algorithms in accessible software libraries with simple user interfaces.

I'm also a big fan of the
[Julia programming language ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://julialang.org/)
!

## ~~~<i class="fas fa-newspaper"></i>~~~ News

- There is a new tutorial and presentation on gate evolution and optimization with ITensor and PastaQ that you can find [here ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://github.com/mtfishman/ITensorTutorials.jl/).
- We now have an initial implementation of 1-site and 2-site TDVP based on the Julia version of ITensor which can be found [here ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://github.com/mtfishman/ITensorTDVP.jl/).
