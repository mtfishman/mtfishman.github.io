# Introduction

Welcome! I'm Matt Fishman,
[Associate Data Scientist at the Center for Computational Quantum Physics (CCQ)](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/matthew-fishman)
at the Flatiron Institute in New York.
I'm lead developer of
[ITensor](https://github.com/ITensor)
, a software library for easily developing and running efficient tensor
network calculations.

I am passionate about developing tensor network algorithms with
applications to quantum physics, quantum computing, chemistry, and data
science, and providing high performance implementations of those
algorithms in accessible software libraries with simple user interfaces.
