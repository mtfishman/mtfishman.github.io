# About Me

### Current Position

Hello! I'm Matt Fishman, Associate Data Scientist at the Center for Computational Quantum Physics (CCQ), Flatiron Institute, New York. Lead developer of [@ITensor](https://github.com/ITensor).

* I am currently the lead developer of ITensor (co-developed with [@emstoudenmire](https://github.com/emstoudenmire)), a leading tensor network software library with applications to quantum physics, quantum computing, machine learning and chemistry.
* ITensor was originally written in [C++](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensor). I led the development of the Julia port called [ITensors.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl), which was officially released in May of 2020.
* Along with [@GTorlai](https://github.com/GTorlai) I am a co-developer of the [PastaQ.jl](https://github.com/GTorlai/PastaQ.jl) Julia library for simulating and analyzing quantum computers.
* I primarily code in Julia and C++ (more in Julia lately).
* I am interesting in writing simple to use and high performance code.
* I am most excited about my recent work in applying tools like automatic differentiation, multithreading, and interactive visualization to improve tensor network software and algorithms.
* I am interested in learning more about applying other high performance computing (HPC) techniques like GPUs and distributed computing to improve tensor network software.
* Check out my repositories and reach out with any questions you have or if you are interested in contributing to the ITensor ecosystem!

### Education

* I received my Ph.D. from Caltech in the Spring of 2018. My thesis was on the development of tensor network algorithms.

### Online Presence

* [Github](https://github.com/mtfishman): Most of my coding projects.
* [ITensor Support](https://itensor.org/support/): I answer questions about ITensor on the support forum.
* [Julia Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/u/mtfishman/summary): I occasionally ask and answer questions.
