# Introduction

Welcome! I'm Matt Fishman,
[Research Scientist and Software Engineer at the Center for Computational Quantum Physics (CCQ)](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/matthew-fishman)
at the Flatiron Institute in New York.
I'm a developer of [ITensor](https://itensor.org),
a software library for easily developing and running efficient tensor
network calculations.

I am passionate about developing tensor network algorithms
(algorithms for low rank approximations of very high order tensors)
with applications to quantum physics, quantum computing,
chemistry, and data science, and providing high performance implementations of those
algorithms in accessible software libraries with simple user interfaces.

I'm also a big fan of the
[Julia programming language ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://julialang.org/)
!
