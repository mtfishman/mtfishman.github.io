# About Me

### Current Work

* [ITensor](https://github.com/ITensor) - I am currently the lead developer of ITensor (co-developed with [Miles Stoudenmire](https://github.com/emstoudenmire)), a leading tensor network software library with applications to quantum physics, quantum computing, machine learning and chemistry written in C++ and Julia.
* [ITensors.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl) - ITensor was originally written in C++ (source code [here](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensor)). I led the development of the Julia port called [ITensors.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl), which was officially released in May of 2020, along with a variety of related Julia packages.
* [PastaQ.jl](https://github.com/GTorlai/PastaQ.jl) - Along with [Giacomo Torlai](https://github.com/GTorlai) I am a co-developer of the [PastaQ.jl](https://github.com/GTorlai/PastaQ.jl) Julia library for simulating and analyzing quantum computers.
* I primarily code in Julia and C++ (more in Julia lately).
* I am interesting in writing simple to use and high performance code that is designed well enough to both be extensible and last for many years.
* I am most excited about my recent work in applying tools like automatic differentiation, multithreading, and interactive visualization to improve tensor network software and algorithms.
* I am interested in learning more about applying other high performance computing (HPC) techniques like GPUs and distributed computing to improve tensor network software.
* Check out my repositories and reach out with any questions you have or if you are interested in contributing to any libraries I develop!

### Education

* PhD in Physics, Caltech, 2018. My thesis was on the development of tensor network algorithms.
* BS in Engineering Physics, Cornell University, 2012.

### Hobbies

* Besides developing algorithms and software, in my free time I like hiking, biking, skiing and kayaking in the Hudson Valley and beyond!
