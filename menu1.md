# My Projects

\toc

## ITensors.jl

I am the lead developer of [ITensors.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl), a full port of the [C++ ITensor library](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensor) to the Julia language.

### ITensorsVisualization.jl

[ITensorsVisualization.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensorsVisualization.jl) is a package I wrote for easily making interactive visualizations of tensor networks written with ITensors.jl.

### ITensorGaussianMPS.jl

[ITensorGaussianMPS.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensorGaussianMPS.jl) is a Julia package I wrote for transforming free fermion states into tensor network states, based on an algorithm I developed during my Ph.D. with Steve White.

### ITensorInfiniteMPS.jl

[ITensorInfiniteMPS.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensorInfiniteMPS.jl) is a Julia package I wrote for extending the functionality of ITensors.jl to infinite MPS.

## PastaQ.jl

[PastaQ.jl](https://github.com/GTorlai/PastaQ.jl) is a package I co-develop with [Giacomo Torlai](https://github.com/GTorlai) for simulating and analyzing quantum computers. 

## ITensor (C++)

## Tensor Network algorithm development
