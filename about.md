# About Me

### Current Work

~~~<i class="fas fa-draw-polygon"></i>~~~
__ITensor__ -
I am currently the lead developer of
[ITensor ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://itensor.org)
(co-developed with 
[Miles Stoudenmire ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://itensor.org/miles)
), a leading tensor network software library with applications to quantum
physics, quantum computing, machine learning, and chemistry written in C++
and Julia.

The primary development of ITensor is happening in the Julia version of the
project now, and most new features are being added there.
We ~~highly~~ recommend that if you are starting a new project or
contributing a new feature, you consider using the Julia version.

If you are unfamiliar with the
[Julia programming language ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://julialang.org/)
, it is a wonderful high performance, high level language with the speed of
C/C++ and the plug-and-play features of Python.
It is perfectly suited for scientific computing!

~~~<i class="fas fa-code"></i>~~~
__ITensors.jl__ -
ITensor was originally written in C++ (see the
[source code ~~~<i class="fab fa-github" title="Github"></i>~~~](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensor)
).
I led the development of
[C++ ITensor Version 3 ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://itensor.org/news.html)
, as well as the full port of ITensor to Julia, called
[ITensors.jl ~~~<i class="fab fa-github" title="Github"></i>~~~](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl)
, which was officially released in May of 2020.
Since then, I've also developed a variety of related
[Julia packages](/projects).

~~~<i class="fas fa-code"></i>~~~  __PastaQ.jl__ -
Along with
[Giacomo Torlai ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://github.com/GTorlai)
I am a co-developer of the
[PastaQ.jl ~~~<i class="fab fa-github" title="Github"></i>~~~](https://github.com/GTorlai/PastaQ.jl)
Julia library for simulating and analyzing quantum computers.
This package is built on top of `ITensors.jl`, and has a variety of quantum
computing and quantum information-specific functionality like noisy gate
evolution, extensive and easily extendable quantum gate and circuit
definitions, variational quantum circuit optimization, state-of-the-art
quantum state and process tomography, along with a growing list of features.

~~~<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>~~~
I primarily code in Julia and C++ (more in Julia lately).

~~~<i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i>~~~
I am interesting in writing simple to use and high performance open source
code that is designed well enough to be both extensible and last for many
years.

~~~<i class="fas fa-rocket"></i>~~~
I am most excited about my recent work in applying tools like automatic
differentiation, multithreading, and interactive visualization to improve
tensor network software and algorithms.

~~~<i class="fas fa-microchip"></i>~~~
I am interested in learning more about applying other high performance
computing (HPC) techniques like GPUs and distributed computing to improve
tensor network software.

~~~<i class="fab fa-github"></i>~~~ Check out my [Github repositories ~~~<i class="fab fa-github" title="Github"></i>~~~](https://github.com/mtfishman) and [reach out](/about/#online_presence) with any questions you have or if you are interested in contributing to any [projects](/projects) I develop!

### Online Presence

[~~~<i class="fas fa-envelope" title="Email"></i>~~~ Email](mailto:mfishman@flatironinstitute.org) -
For general questions, feel free to email me directly.
This is probably the best way to reach me.
I receive a lot of email, if I don't respond it may have gotten buried in
my inbox so please email me again to remind me to respond.

[~~~<i class="fab fa-github" title="Github"></i>~~~ Github](https://github.com/mtfishman) - Here you can find most of my coding projects and activity. If there are problems or missing features on coding projects I work on, please raise an issue on the Github repository of the corresponding [project](/projects) or make a pull request if you have a fix (though it is best to check with me before starting a pull request, since my collaborators and I may already be working on the same issue or have a specific design in mind). If I don't respond, feel free to bug me with comments on Github or by email.

[~~~<i class="fas fa-draw-polygon" title="ITensor Support"></i>~~~ ITensor Support](https://itensor.org/support) - I answer questions about ITensor on our support forum. This is a good place to ask ITensor-specific questions, like how to use ITensor for your particular problem.

[~~~<i class="fas fa-code" title="Julia Discourse"></i>~~~ Julia Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/u/mtfishman/summary) - I occasionally ask and answer questions on Julia discourse, but look at it almost every day to keep up with developments in Julia. You can send me a private message on Julia Discourse as an alternative to emailing me. Additionally, you can ask questions about the Julia version of ITensor here and I will try to answer, please add the [ITensor tag ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://discourse.julialang.org/tag/itensor) to your post.

[~~~<i class="fas fa-building" title="CCQ Profile"></i>~~~ CCQ Profile](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/matthew-fishman) - This is my current work profile.

[~~~<i class="ai ai-google-scholar" title="Google Scholar"></i>~~~ Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SMjCBTsAAAAJ&hl=en) - Here you can find an up to date list of my publications.

### Education

[~~~<i class="fas fa-graduation-cap" title="Caltech"></i>~~~](https://pma.caltech.edu) PhD in Physics, Caltech, 2018. [My thesis ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/10992) was on the development of tensor network algorithms.

[~~~<i class="fas fa-graduation-cap" title="Cornell"></i>~~~](https://www.aep.cornell.edu) BS in Engineering Physics, Cornell University, 2012. I did undergraduate research using computational methods like density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) to study the surface stability of copper.

### Hobbies

~~~<i class="fas fa-skiing-nordic" title="Ski"></i>~~~ Besides developing algorithms and software, in my free time I like hiking, biking, skiing and kayaking in the Hudson Valley and beyond!
