### Current Work

~~~<i class="fas fa-draw-polygon"></i>~~~
__ITensor__ -
My primary project these days is developing
[ITensor ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://itensor.org),
a leading tensor network software library with applications to quantum
physics, quantum computing, machine learning, and chemistry primarily written in Julia,
with a legacy implementation C++.

Most of the development of ITensor is happening in the Julia version of the
project now, and most new features are being added there.
We _highly_ recommend that if you are starting a new project or
contributing a new feature, you consider using the Julia version.

If you are unfamiliar with the
[Julia programming language ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://julialang.org/)
, it is a wonderful high performance, high level language with the speed of
C/C++ and the plug-and-play features of Python.
It is perfectly suited for scientific computing!

~~~<i class="fas fa-code"></i>~~~
__ITensors.jl__ -
ITensor was originally written in C++ (see the
[source code ~~~<i class="fab fa-github"></i>~~~](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensor)
).
I led the development of
[C++ ITensor Version 3 ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://itensor.org/news.html)
, as well as the full port of ITensor to Julia, called
[ITensors.jl ~~~<i class="fab fa-github"></i>~~~](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl)
, which was officially released in May of 2020.
Since then, I've also developed a variety of related
[Julia packages ~~~<i class="fab fa-github"></i>~~~](https://github.com/mtfishman).

~~~<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>~~~
I primarily code in Julia and C++ (more in Julia lately).

~~~<i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i>~~~
I am interesting in writing simple to use and high performance open source
code that is designed well enough to be both extensible and last for many
years.

~~~<i class="fas fa-rocket"></i>~~~
I am most excited about my recent work in applying tools like graph theory, automatic
differentiation, GPUs, multithreading, and interactive visualization to improve
tensor network software and algorithms.

~~~<i class="fas fa-microchip"></i>~~~
I am interested in learning more about applying other high performance
computing (HPC) techniques like GPUs and distributed computing to improve
tensor network software.

### Online Presence

[~~~<i class="fab fa-github"></i>~~~ Github](https://github.com/mtfishman) - Here you can find most of my coding projects and activity. If there are problems or missing features on coding projects I work on, please raise an issue on the Github repository of the corresponding project. Before making a pull request with a bug fix or new feature, please raise an issue first, since my collaborators and I may already be working on the same issue or have a specific design in mind.

[~~~<i class="fab fa-discourse"></i>~~~ ITensor Discussion Forum](https://itensor.discourse.group) - I answer questions about ITensor on our discussion forum. This is a good place to ask ITensor-specific questions, for example questions on how to use ITensor.

[~~~<i class="fab fa-discourse"></i>~~~ Julia Discussion Forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/u/mtfishman/summary) - I occasionally ask and answer questions on Julia discourse, but look at it almost every day to keep up with developments in Julia.

[~~~<i class="fas fa-building"></i>~~~ Work Profile](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/matthew-fishman) - This is my current work profile for my job as a Research Scientist and Software Engineer (Research Scientist-Software) at the Center for Computational Quantum Physics, part of the Flatiron Institute, the internal research division of the Simons Foundation.

[~~~<i class="ai ai-google-scholar"></i>~~~ Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SMjCBTsAAAAJ&hl=en) - Here you can find an up to date list of my publications.

### Education

[~~~<i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i>~~~](https://pma.caltech.edu) PhD in Physics, Caltech, 2018. [My thesis ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/10992) was on the development of tensor network algorithms.

[~~~<i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i>~~~](https://www.aep.cornell.edu) BS in Engineering Physics, Cornell University, 2012. I did undergraduate research using computational methods like density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) to study the surface stability of copper.

### Hobbies

~~~<i class="fas fa-skiing-nordic"></i>~~~ Besides developing algorithms and software, in my free time I like hiking, biking, skiing and kayaking in the Hudson Valley and beyond!
