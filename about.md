# About Me

### Current Work

~~~<i class="fas fa-draw-polygon"></i>~~~
__ITensor__ -
I am currently the lead developer of
[ITensor ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://itensor.org)
(co-developed with 
[Miles Stoudenmire ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://itensor.org/miles)
), a leading tensor network software library with applications to quantum
physics, quantum computing, machine learning, and chemistry written in C++
and Julia.

The primary development of ITensor is happening in the Julia version of the
project now, and most new features are being added there.
We _highly_ recommend that if you are starting a new project or
contributing a new feature, you consider using the Julia version.

If you are unfamiliar with the
[Julia programming language ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://julialang.org/)
, it is a wonderful high performance, high level language with the speed of
C/C++ and the plug-and-play features of Python.
It is perfectly suited for scientific computing!

~~~<i class="fas fa-code"></i>~~~
__ITensors.jl__ -
ITensor was originally written in C++ (see the
[source code ~~~<i class="fab fa-github"></i>~~~](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensor)
).
I led the development of
[C++ ITensor Version 3 ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://itensor.org/news.html)
, as well as the full port of ITensor to Julia, called
[ITensors.jl ~~~<i class="fab fa-github"></i>~~~](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl)
, which was officially released in May of 2020.
Since then, I've also developed a variety of related
[Julia packages](/projects).

~~~<i class="fas fa-code"></i>~~~  __PastaQ.jl__ -
Along with
[Giacomo Torlai ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://github.com/GTorlai)
I am a co-developer of the
[PastaQ.jl ~~~<i class="fab fa-github"></i>~~~](https://github.com/GTorlai/PastaQ.jl)
Julia library for simulating and analyzing quantum computers.
This package is built on top of `ITensors.jl`, and has a variety of quantum
computing and quantum information-specific functionality like noisy gate
evolution, extensive and easily extendable quantum gate and circuit
definitions, variational quantum circuit optimization, state-of-the-art
quantum state and process tomography, along with a growing list of features.

~~~<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>~~~
I primarily code in Julia and C++ (more in Julia lately).

~~~<i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i>~~~
I am interesting in writing simple to use and high performance open source
code that is designed well enough to be both extensible and last for many
years.

~~~<i class="fas fa-rocket"></i>~~~
I am most excited about my recent work in applying tools like automatic
differentiation, multithreading, and interactive visualization to improve
tensor network software and algorithms.

~~~<i class="fas fa-microchip"></i>~~~
I am interested in learning more about applying other high performance
computing (HPC) techniques like GPUs and distributed computing to improve
tensor network software.

~~~<i class="fab fa-github"></i>~~~ Check out my [Github repositories ~~~<i class="fab fa-github"></i>~~~](https://github.com/mtfishman) and [reach out](/about/#online_presence) with any questions you have or if you are interested in contributing to any [projects](/projects) I develop!

### Online Presence

[~~~<i class="fas fa-envelope"></i>~~~ Email](mailto:mfishman@flatironinstitute.org) -
For general questions, feel free to email me directly.
I receive a lot of email, if I don't respond it may have gotten buried in
my inbox so please email me again to remind me to respond.
If you have questions about how to use ITensor, it is better to ask
on the [ITensor Discourse forum](https://itensor.discourse.group).
If you have issues or feature request for a software that I develop,
it is better to raise an issue in the appropriate Github repository.

[~~~<i class="fab fa-github"></i>~~~ Github](https://github.com/mtfishman) - Here you can find most of my coding projects and activity. If there are problems or missing features on coding projects I work on, please raise an issue on the Github repository of the corresponding [project](/projects) or make a pull request if you have a fix (though it is best to check with me before starting a pull request, since my collaborators and I may already be working on the same issue or have a specific design in mind). If I don't respond, feel free to bug me with comments on Github or by email.

[~~~<i class="fab fa-discourse"></i>~~~ ITensor Discussion Forum](https://itensor.discourse.group) - I answer questions about ITensor on our discussion forum. This is a good place to ask ITensor-specific questions, for example questions on how to use ITensor.

[~~~<i class="fab fa-discourse"></i>~~~ Julia Discussion Forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/u/mtfishman/summary) - I occasionally ask and answer questions on Julia discourse, but look at it almost every day to keep up with developments in Julia.

[~~~<i class="fas fa-building"></i>~~~ Work Profile](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/matthew-fishman) - This is my current work profile for my job as a Research Scientist and Software Engineer (Research Scientist-Software) at the Center for Computational Quantum Physics, part of the Flatiron Institute, the internal research division of the Simons Foundation.

[~~~<i class="ai ai-google-scholar"></i>~~~ Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SMjCBTsAAAAJ&hl=en) - Here you can find an up to date list of my publications.

### Education

[~~~<i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i>~~~](https://pma.caltech.edu) PhD in Physics, Caltech, 2018. [My thesis ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/10992) was on the development of tensor network algorithms.

[~~~<i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i>~~~](https://www.aep.cornell.edu) BS in Engineering Physics, Cornell University, 2012. I did undergraduate research using computational methods like density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) to study the surface stability of copper.

### Hobbies

~~~<i class="fas fa-skiing-nordic"></i>~~~ Besides developing algorithms and software, in my free time I like hiking, biking, skiing and kayaking in the Hudson Valley and beyond!
