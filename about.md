### Current Work

~~~<i class="fas fa-draw-polygon"></i>~~~  __ITensor__ - I am currently the lead developer of [ITensor ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://itensor.org) (co-developed with [Miles Stoudenmire ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://itensor.org/miles)), a leading tensor network software library with applications to quantum physics, quantum computing, machine learning and chemistry written in C++ and Julia.

~~~<i class="fas fa-code"></i>~~~  __ITensors.jl__ - ITensor was originally written in C++ (see the [source code ~~~<i class="fab fa-github" title="Github"></i>~~~](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensor)). I led the development of [C++ ITensor Version 3 ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://itensor.org/news.html), as well as the full port of ITensor to Julia, called [ITensors.jl ~~~<i class="fab fa-github" title="Github"></i>~~~](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl), which was officially released in May of 2020. Since then, I've also developed a variety of related [Julia packages](/projects).

~~~<i class="fas fa-code"></i>~~~  __PastaQ.jl__ - Along with [Giacomo Torlai ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://github.com/GTorlai) I am a co-developer of the [PastaQ.jl ~~~<i class="fab fa-github" title="Github"></i>~~~](https://github.com/GTorlai/PastaQ.jl) Julia library for simulating and analyzing quantum computers.

~~~<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>~~~ I primarily code in Julia and C++ (more in Julia lately).

~~~<i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i>~~~ I am interesting in writing simple to use and high performance open source code that is designed well enough to be both extensible and last for many years.

~~~<i class="fas fa-rocket"></i>~~~ I am most excited about my recent work in applying tools like automatic differentiation, multithreading, and interactive visualization to improve tensor network software and algorithms.

~~~<i class="fas fa-microchip"></i>~~~ I am interested in learning more about applying other high performance computing (HPC) techniques like GPUs and distributed computing to improve tensor network software.

~~~<i class="fab fa-github"></i>~~~ Check out my repositories and reach out with any questions you have or if you are interested in contributing to any [projects](/projects) I develop!

### Online Presence

[~~~<i class="fas fa-envelope" title="Email"></i>~~~ Email](mailto:mfishman@flatironinstitute.org) - For general questions, feel free to email me directly. I receive a lot of email, if I don't respond it may have gotten buried in my inbox so please email me again to remind me to respond.

[~~~<i class="fab fa-github" title="Github"></i>~~~ Github](https://github.com/mtfishman) - Here you can find most of my coding projects and activity. If there are problems or missing features on coding projects I work on, please raise an issue on the Github repository of the corresponding [project](/projects) or make a pull request if you have a fix. If I don't respond, feel free to bug me with comments on Github or by email.

[~~~<i class="fas fa-draw-polygon" title="ITensor Support"></i>~~~ ITensor Support](https://itensor.org/support) - I answer questions about ITensor on our support forum. This is a good place to ask ITensor-specific questions, like how to use ITensor for your particular problem.

[~~~<i class="fas fa-code" title="Julia Discourse"></i>~~~ Julia Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/u/mtfishman/summary) - I occasionally ask and answer questions on Julia discourse, but look at it almost every day to keep up with developments in Julia. You can send me a private message on Julia Discourse as an alternative to emailing me. Additionally, you can ask questions about the Julia version of ITensor here and I will try to answer, please add the [ITensor tag ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://discourse.julialang.org/tag/itensor) to your post.

[~~~<i class="fas fa-building" title="CCQ Profile"></i>~~~ CCQ Profile](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/matthew-fishman) - This is my current work profile.

[~~~<i class="ai ai-google-scholar" title="Google Scholar"></i>~~~ Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SMjCBTsAAAAJ&hl=en) - Here you can find an up to date list of my publications.

### Education

[~~~<i class="fas fa-graduation-cap" title="Caltech"></i>~~~](https://pma.caltech.edu) PhD in Physics, Caltech, 2018. [My thesis ~~~<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>~~~](https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/10992) was on the development of tensor network algorithms.

[~~~<i class="fas fa-graduation-cap" title="Cornell"></i>~~~](https://www.aep.cornell.edu) BS in Engineering Physics, Cornell University, 2012. I did undergraduate research using computational methods like density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) to study the surface stability of copper.

### Hobbies

~~~<i class="fas fa-skiing-nordic" title="Ski"></i>~~~ Besides developing algorithms and software, in my free time I like hiking, biking, skiing and kayaking in the Hudson Valley and beyond!
