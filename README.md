# [mtfishman.github.io](https://mtfishman.github.io)
Source code for [mtfishman.github.io](https://mtfishman.github.io), the personal website of Matt Fishman ([@mtfishman](https://github.com/mtfishman)), Associate Data Scientist at the Flatiron Institute Center for Computational Quantum Physics (CCQ).

The site is built with [Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl), based on the [basic Franklin template](https://tlienart.github.io/FranklinTemplates.jl).

To build and view the website locally, first [install Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads).
Then clone the repository locally, and in the base directly run:
```julia
$ julia

julia> using Franklin

julia> serve()
[...]
```
