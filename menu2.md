## Lazy Operator Algebra

In [ITensors.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl) I have been working on a lazy algebraic system for taking sums and products of operators. (In progress, stayed tuned to find out more!)


## Automatic Differentiation of Tensor Networks

Here we will give an overview of using automatic differentiation of tensor networks with ITensor. Many of this is available in the [ITensors.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl) package. (In progress, stayed tuned to find out more!)

## Visualizing Tensor Networks with Makie

Here we will give an introduction to visualizing tensor network with Makie. This is ongoing work in the package [ITensorsVisualization.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensorsVisualization.jl). (In progress, stayed tuned to find out more!)
